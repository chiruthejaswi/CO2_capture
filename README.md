# CO₂ Solubility Prediction in Ionic Liquids Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the **solubility of CO₂ in ionic liquids** using **molecular descriptors** derived from SMILES strings. It combines **chemistry** and **machine learning** to support carbon capture research.

We extract meaningful features from ionic compound structures and train ML models such as **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** to predict CO₂ solubility under varying conditions of **temperature** and **pressure**.

## Problem Statement

> **Goal:** Predict the solubility of CO₂ in ionic liquids given:
> - Molecular structure of cation and anion (SMILES)
> - Temperature and pressure conditions

Understanding and improving solubility predictions can help design better solvents for **carbon capture and storage (CCS)** technologies.

## Features Used

Molecular descriptors were generated using RDKit:

- `MolWt` (Molecular Weight): Heavier ions allow more CO₂ absorption.
- `NumHAcceptors` (HBA): Weakly attracts CO₂ via electrostatic forces.
- `NumHDonors` (HBD): Excess polarity repels non-polar CO₂.
- `Temperature (T)`: High temperatures decrease solubility (exothermic process).
- `Pressure (P)`: High pressure increases solubility (Henry’s Law).
